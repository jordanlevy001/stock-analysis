## Results Analysis

### Project Overview

#### The purpose of this analysis is to refactor the module 2 solution code. The refactored code should loop through all of the stock data one time to collect information on the stock's total daily volume and the return. Additionally, we will determine the new run time and evaluate how it compared to the run time of the subroutine before the code was refactored.
